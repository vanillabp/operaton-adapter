#
# Makes the code of this repository again from a commit of the Camunda 7 adapter, and commits
# the result to the branch 'generated'.
#
# The branch 'generated' holds nothing but what this script writes. 'main' merges it, so a
# Camunda 7 change reaches 'main' as an ordinary merge. Conflicts appear only where 'main' has
# its own fixes on top. CONTRIBUTING.md, section "Following the Camunda 7 adapter", says what to
# do before and after the merge.
#
# What the script does, in this order:
#
#   1. It clones the Camunda 7 adapter and checks out the given commit.
#   2. It copies that tree into a worktree of 'generated'. The files in KEPT_BY_MAIN stay out,
#      because 'main' writes its own. The recipe file and the script which lists the type
#      renames come from the checkout this script runs in, not from Camunda 7.
#   3. It runs Operaton's OpenRewrite recipe. That one renames what belongs to the engine:
#      packages, Maven coordinates, the getters of the model API.
#   4. It lists the type renames and runs VanillaBP's recipe rewrite/vanillabp-operaton.yml.
#      That one pins the Operaton version and renames what belongs to VanillaBP: the Java
#      package, the classes, the adapter type, the names in strings.
#   5. It formats the result with the Spotless rules of the repository.
#   6. It commits the result as "generated from C7 <full sha>". It does not push.
#
# Usage:
#   bin/sync-from-camunda7.sh <camunda7 commit or tag>
#
# Environment:
#   C7_REPOSITORY   where the Camunda 7 adapter is cloned from (default: the hub repository)
#   MAVEN_ARGS      Maven reads this itself, in every call. For instance
#                   '-Dmaven.repo.local=/tmp/m2' keeps the run out of your local repository.
#
# The two recipes take about ten minutes together. On an error the script stops and leaves
# its working directory behind, so the error can be read there. It prints where that is.
